# Archie Init — Full Architecture Analysis

Analyze this repository's architecture. Zero dependencies — works with any language.

**Prerequisites:** Run `npx archie` first to install the scripts. If `.archie/scanner.py` doesn't exist, tell the user to run `npx archie` and try again.

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT write inline Python scripts or bash one-liners. Every step uses a pre-installed script from `.archie/`. Just run the bash commands shown. Do NOT generate code to parse JSON, extract data, or create files. The scripts handle everything. If a step produces an error, follow the instructions for that step exactly — do not improvise workarounds.**

## Step 1: Run the scanner

```bash
python3 .archie/scanner.py "$PWD"
```

## Step 2: Read scan results

Read `.archie/scan.json`. Note total files, detected frameworks, and top-level directories. Check if frontend code is detected (look for React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Next.js, Nuxt, Flutter, SwiftUI, Jetpack Compose, React Native, etc. in frameworks or file extensions like .tsx, .jsx, .vue, .svelte, .dart, .swift, .kt).

## Step 3: Spawn parallel analytical agents

Spawn 3–4 Opus subagents in parallel (Agent tool, `model: "opus"`), each focused on a different analytical concern. ALL agents read ALL source files — they are not split by directory. Each agent gets: the scan.json file_tree, dependencies, config files, and the GROUNDING RULES at the end of this step.

**If frontend code was detected in Step 2, spawn all 4 agents (A–D). Otherwise spawn only agents A–C.**

---

### Agent A: "Structure & Components"

> **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
> You are analyzing a codebase to understand its architecture. Your goal is to OBSERVE and DESCRIBE what exists, NOT to categorize it into known patterns.
>
> **DO NOT:**
> - Assume this is a "layered architecture", "MVC", "Clean Architecture", or any specific pattern
> - Look for patterns that match your training data
> - Force observations into predefined categories
>
> **DO:**
> - Describe the ACTUAL file organization you see
> - Identify how files relate to each other based on naming and imports
> - Note any conventions unique to this codebase
>
> Read all source files. Analyze the actual structure of this codebase:
>
> ### 1. Project Type & Platforms
> - Identify if this is a monorepo, single app, microservice, serverless, full-stack, library, etc.
> - List ALL platforms found: backend, web-frontend, mobile-ios, mobile-android, desktop, CLI, shared/common
> - List main entry point files for EACH platform (main.py, index.ts, App.tsx, AppDelegate.swift, MainActivity.kt, main.dart, etc.)
> - Document module/package organization approach
>
> ### 2. Components
> Identify main components from actual code — class names, imports, file organization. For each component:
> - **name**: Component name
> - **location**: Directory path (MUST exist in file_tree)
> - **platform**: backend | frontend | shared | ios | android
> - **responsibility**: Describe what the code DOES, not what names suggest. BAD: "Handles business logic". GOOD: "Orchestrates weather data fetching via WeatherProvider, manages profile state, coordinates push notification scheduling". Reference actual class names and services.
> - **depends_on**: From actual import statements
> - **exposes_to**: What other components consume from it
> - **key_interfaces**: Actual method/function names with brief description. For API routes, list ONLY methods actually implemented — do NOT assume CRUD.
> - **key_files**: With descriptions of what each file does (paths MUST exist in file_tree)
>
> ### 3. Layers
> Analyze ALL platforms (backend AND frontend). Only document layers you can clearly identify from:
> 1. Import patterns between directories
> 2. Directory structure and naming
> 3. Actual code organization
>
> **If no clear layers exist**, set structure_type to flat, modular, or feature-based and document the actual structure.
>
> For each layer found, document: name, platform (backend|frontend|shared), location, responsibility (SPECIFIC — reference actual classes), contains (component types), depends_on (from imports), exposes_to, key_files.
>
> Common backend patterns (only if they ACTUALLY exist): Presentation/API (routes, controllers, DTOs), Application/Service (orchestration, use cases), Domain (entities, interfaces), Infrastructure (database, external APIs, caching).
> Common frontend patterns (only if they ACTUALLY exist): Pages/Views, Features/Containers, Components/UI, Hooks/Services, State/Store.
>
> ### 4. Architecture Style
> Describe in plain language. Examples: "Actor-based with message passing", "Event-sourced with CQRS separation", "Feature-sliced with co-located concerns", "Traditional layered with services and repositories", "Functional core with imperative shell" — or describe something completely unique.
>
> ### 5. File Placement & Naming
> - Where do tests, configs, components, services actually live? With naming patterns observed.
> - Search the file_tree for where test files, config files, build output, and generated code actually live. Do NOT assume conventional locations.
> - Document actual naming conventions: PascalCase components, snake_case utils, kebab-case files, etc. With 2-4 examples each.
>
> ### 6. Framework Usage
> Catalog external frameworks/libraries from import statements. For each, note the framework name and usage scope.
>
> Return JSON:
> ```json
> {
>   "meta": {
>     "architecture_style": "plain language description",
>     "platforms": ["backend", "web-frontend"],
>     "executive_summary": "3-5 factual sentences: what this does, primary tech, architecture style. No filler."
>   },
>   "components": {
>     "structure_type": "layered | flat | modular | feature-based",
>     "components": [
>       {"name": "", "location": "", "platform": "", "responsibility": "", "depends_on": [], "exposes_to": [], "key_interfaces": [{"name": "", "methods": [], "description": ""}], "key_files": [{"file": "", "description": ""}]}
>     ]
>   },
>   "architecture_rules": {
>     "file_placement_rules": [
>       {"component_type": "", "naming_pattern": "", "location": "", "example": "", "description": ""}
>     ],
>     "naming_conventions": [
>       {"scope": "", "pattern": "", "examples": [], "description": ""}
>     ]
>   }
> }
> ```

### Agent B: "Patterns & Communication"

> Read all source files. Analyze design patterns and communication across ALL platforms (backend AND frontend).
>
> ### 1. Structural Patterns (identify with concrete examples)
> **Backend:**
> - **Dependency Injection**: How are dependencies wired? Container? Manual? Framework? (@inject, providers, etc.)

> - **Optimistic Updates**: How are UI updates handled before server confirmation?
> - **State Machines**: Any explicit state machine patterns?
>
> ### 3. Cross-Cutting Patterns
> - **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions? Error boundaries? Global handler? Error mapping? What errors map to what status codes?
> - **Validation**: Where? How? What library? Client-side vs server-side?
> - **Authentication**: JWT? Session? OAuth? Where validated? How propagated to frontend?
> - **Logging**: Structured? What logger? What's logged?
> - **Caching**: What's cached? TTL strategy? Browser cache? Server cache?
>
> For each: concern, approach, location (actual file paths).
>
> ### 4. Internal Communication
> - **Backend**: Direct method calls between layers, in-process events, message buses
> - **Frontend**: Props, Context, event emitters, pub/sub, state management stores

> Categories: AI/LLM providers, payment processors, auth providers, storage services, analytics/monitoring, CDN/asset hosting.
>
> ### 7. Frontend-Backend Contract
> - How do frontend and backend communicate? (REST, GraphQL, tRPC, WebSocket, etc.)
> - Are types shared between frontend and backend?
> - How are API errors propagated to the UI?
>
> ### 8. Pattern Selection Guide
> For common scenarios in this codebase, which pattern should be used and why?
>
> Return JSON:
> ```json
> {
>   "communication": {
>     "patterns": [
>       {"name": "", "when_to_use": "", "how_it_works": "", "examples": []}
>     ],
>     "integrations": [
>       {"service": "", "purpose": "", "integration_point": ""}
>     ],
>     "pattern_selection_guide": [
>       {"scenario": "", "pattern": "", "rationale": ""}
>     ]
>   },
>   "quick_reference": {
>     "pattern_selection": {"scenario": "pattern"},
>     "error_mapping": [{"error": "", "status_code": 0, "description": ""}]
>   }
> }
> ```

### Agent C: "Technology, Deployment & Rules"

**Every agent also gets these GROUNDING RULES:**

> **GROUNDING RULES — every claim must come from code you READ, never from names or conventions.**
> This applies to ANY codebase — web, mobile, desktop, backend, CLI, library, any language.
>
> 1. **Paths**: Only reference file/directory paths that appear in scan.json file_tree. Do NOT infer conventional paths — every framework has different conventions (Rails uses `spec/`, Go uses `_test.go` files, Swift uses `Tests/`, etc.). Find the ACTUAL paths by reading the code.
> 2. **Component responsibility**: Read the actual source file. Describe what the code DOES, not what the filename or class name suggests. A file named `Publisher.swift` might only subscribe to events. A class named `UserManager` might only read, never write. Only the code tells you which.
> 3. **API/route/endpoint methods**: Read the actual handler code. List ONLY the methods/verbs/actions that are actually implemented. Do NOT assume CRUD from the resource name — a "presets" endpoint might support GET+PUT but not POST. This applies to HTTP routes, gRPC services, GraphQL resolvers, CLI commands, or any interface.
> 4. **File placement rules**: Search the file_tree for where test files, config files, build output, and generated code actually live. Do NOT assume conventional locations — the project might put tests alongside source, in a top-level `test/` dir, or anywhere else.
> 5. **Pitfalls**: Only describe problems grounded in actual code patterns you observed. Describe what the code DOES and the risks of THAT pattern. Do NOT recommend alternatives the code doesn't use as if it does.
> 6. **Build/output paths**: Read the build config, generation logic, or Makefile to find where output is actually written. Do NOT assume any framework's default output directory.
>
> **The rule is simple: if you didn't read it in a file, don't claim it.** Focus on cross-file relationships, architecture decisions, conventions, and integration patterns. Return ONLY valid JSON.

**Spawn ALL agents in parallel.**

## Step 4: Save Wave 1 output and merge

After each subagent completes, use the Write tool to save its JSON output to a temporary file. Save the COMPLETE output text — the merge script handles JSON extraction.

```
Write /tmp/archie_sub1.json with Agent A's output
Write /tmp/archie_sub2.json with Agent B's output
Write /tmp/archie_sub3.json with Agent C's output
Write /tmp/archie_sub4.json with Agent D's output (if spawned)
```

Then merge:

```bash
python3 .archie/merge.py "$PWD" /tmp/archie_sub1.json /tmp/archie_sub2.json /tmp/archie_sub3.json /tmp/archie_sub4.json
```

This saves `.archie/blueprint_raw.json` (raw merged data).

## Step 5: Wave 2 — Agent X ("Architectural Reasoning")

Wave 1 gathered facts: components, patterns, technology, deployment, frontend. Now spawn a single Opus subagent (`model: "opus"`) that reads ALL Wave 1 output and produces deep architectural reasoning.

Tell Agent X:

> Read `.archie/blueprint_raw.json` — it contains the full analysis from Wave 1 agents: components, communication patterns, technology stack, deployment, frontend. Also read key source files: entry points, main configs, core abstractions.
>
> With the COMPLETE picture of what was built and how, produce deep architectural reasoning:
>
> ### 1. Decision Chain
> Trace the root constraint(s) that shaped this architecture. Build a dependency tree:
> - What is the ROOT constraint? (e.g., "local-first tool requiring filesystem access")
> - What does it FORCE? (each forced decision)
> - What does EACH forced decision FORCE in turn?
> - Continue until you reach leaf decisions
> - For EACH node, include `violation_keywords`: specific code patterns or package names that would violate this decision (e.g., for "SQLite only" → `["pg", "mongoose", "prisma", "typeorm", "postgres"]`)
>
> Every decision in the chain must be grounded in code you can see in the blueprint or source files. Do NOT invent theoretical constraints.
>
> ### 2. Architectural Style Decision
> THE top-level architecture choice. You can see the full component list, pattern list, and tech stack — explain WHY this architecture, not just WHAT. Reference specific components and patterns from the blueprint.
> - **title**: e.g., "Full-stack monolith with subprocess orchestration"
> - **chosen**: What was chosen and how it manifests
> - **rationale**: WHY — reference specific components, patterns, and tech stack items from the blueprint
> - **alternatives_rejected**: What alternatives were NOT chosen and WHY they were ruled out by the constraints
>
> ### 3. Key Decisions (3-7)
> Each with: title, chosen, rationale, alternatives_rejected.
> - **rationale** must reference specific components, patterns, or tech from the blueprint
> - **forced_by**: What constraint or other decision made this one necessary
> - **enables**: What this decision makes possible downstream
>
> ### 4. Trade-offs (3-5)
> Each with: accept, benefit, caused_by (which decision created this trade-off), violation_signals (code patterns that would indicate someone is undoing this trade-off, e.g., removing Puppeteer → `["uninstall puppeteer", "remove puppeteer", "playwright"]`)
>
> ### 5. Out-of-Scope
> What this codebase does NOT do. For each item, optionally note which decision makes it out of scope.
>
> ### 6. Pitfalls (3-5)
> Each with:
> - **area**, **description**, **recommendation**
> - **stems_from**: NOT just a label — the FULL causal chain as an array. Example: `["local-first constraint", "chose SQLite for zero-config", "singleton pattern in db.ts", "no connection recovery on corruption"]`. Each element is a step in the chain from root decision to pitfall.
> - **applies_to**: file paths where this pitfall is relevant
>
> Only describe problems grounded in actual code. Do NOT recommend alternatives the code doesn't use.
>
> ### 7. Architecture Diagram
> Mermaid `graph TD` with 8-12 nodes. You have the full component list and communication patterns from the blueprint — use actual component names and real data flows.
>
> ### 8. Implementation Guidelines (5-8)
> Capabilities using third-party libraries. Cross-reference the tech stack and pattern list from the blueprint. For each:
> - **capability**: Human-readable name
> - **category**: auth | notifications | media | storage | networking | analytics | persistence | ui | payments | location | state_management | navigation | testing
> - **libraries**: Libraries used with versions (from tech stack)
> - **pattern_description**: Architecture pattern, main service/class, data flow
> - **key_files**: Actual file paths (MUST exist in file_tree)
> - **usage_example**: Brief code snippet (max 1 line)
> - **tips**: Gotchas specific to this implementation
>
> Return JSON:
> ```json
> {
>   "decisions": {
>     "architectural_style": {"title": "", "chosen": "", "rationale": "", "alternatives_rejected": []},
>     "key_decisions": [{"title": "", "chosen": "", "rationale": "", "alternatives_rejected": [], "forced_by": "", "enables": ""}],
>     "trade_offs": [{"accept": "", "benefit": "", "caused_by": "", "violation_signals": []}],
>     "out_of_scope": [],
>     "decision_chain": {"root": "", "forces": [{"decision": "", "rationale": "", "violation_keywords": [], "forces": []}]}
>   },
>   "pitfalls": [{"area": "", "description": "", "recommendation": "", "stems_from": ["causal", "chain", "steps"], "applies_to": []}],
>   "architecture_diagram": "graph TD\n  A[...] --> B[...]",
>   "implementation_guidelines": [
>     {"capability": "", "category": "", "libraries": [], "pattern_description": "", "key_files": [], "usage_example": "", "tips": []}
>   ]
> }
> ```

Agent X also gets the GROUNDING RULES from Step 3.

After Agent X completes, save its output and merge into the blueprint:

```
Write /tmp/archie_sub_x.json with Agent X's output
```

```bash
python3 .archie/merge.py "$PWD" /tmp/archie_sub_x.json
```

This merges Agent X's sections (decisions, pitfalls, architecture_diagram, implementation_guidelines) into `blueprint_raw.json`.

## Step 6: AI-normalize the blueprint

The raw blueprint has correct data but inconsistent field names (subagents return arbitrary shapes). A single AI normalizer call reshapes everything to the canonical schema.

1. Generate the normalizer prompt:
```bash
python3 .archie/normalize.py prompt "$PWD" > /tmp/archie_normalize_prompt.txt
```

2. Read `/tmp/archie_normalize_prompt.txt`

3. Spawn a single Opus subagent (`model: "opus"`). Tell it:

   > Read `/tmp/archie_normalize_prompt.txt`. It contains raw blueprint data and the canonical schema. Reshape the data to match the schema and write the result as valid JSON to `.archie/blueprint_normalized.json` using the Write tool.

   > **Rules:** Preserve all data exactly as provided. Do NOT infer, add, or change file paths, HTTP methods, or component descriptions. Your job is to reshape the structure, not to add content. Output ONLY valid JSON to the file — no markdown fences, no commentary.

   **IMPORTANT:** The subagent must write `.archie/blueprint_normalized.json` itself using the Write tool. Do NOT try to extract JSON from the subagent's response.

4. Apply the normalized blueprint:
```bash
python3 .archie/normalize.py apply "$PWD"
```

This saves the canonical `.archie/blueprint.json`.

## Step 7: Render and validate

```bash
python3 .archie/renderer.py "$PWD"
python3 .archie/intent_layer.py "$PWD"
python3 .archie/rules.py "$PWD"
python3 .archie/install_hooks.py "$PWD"
```

Run all four commands. They read `.archie/blueprint.json` and generate everything.

Then validate the output against the actual codebase:

```bash
python3 .archie/validate.py all "$PWD"
```

**Review the validation output.** If there are FAIL results:
- **path_exists failures** (e.g. `public/output` doesn't exist) — the blueprint has a wrong path. Read `.archie/blueprint.json`, find the incorrect path, and fix it to match the actual directory from scan.json. Save the corrected blueprint and re-run the four render commands above.
- **http_methods failures** (e.g. claims GET/POST but exports GET/PUT) — read the actual route file, fix the `key_interfaces.methods` array in the blueprint, save, and re-render.
- **component_verb warnings** — update the component `responsibility` field in the blueprint to match what the code actually does.

After fixes, re-run `python3 .archie/validate.py all "$PWD"` to confirm 0 failures.

**IMPORTANT:** Do ONE fix pass at most. If failures remain after one fix pass, proceed to Step 8 — do not loop. Do NOT write inline Python scripts to patch the blueprint. Template patterns like `{resource}` or `{timestamp}` in descriptive fields are expected and not real failures.

## Step 8: AI-enrich per-folder CLAUDE.md

The per-folder CLAUDE.md files generated in Step 6 are deterministic (file lists, component info). This step enriches them with AI-generated patterns, anti-patterns, debugging tips, and code examples using bottom-up DAG scheduling.

1. Prepare the folder DAG:
```bash
python3 .archie/enrich.py prepare "$PWD"
mkdir -p .archie/enrichments
```

2. Process in readiness waves. Maintain a list of done folder paths (starts empty).

   **Repeat until done:**

   a. Get ready folders (folders whose children are all done, or leaves with no children):
   ```bash
   python3 .archie/enrich.py next-ready "$PWD" <done1> <done2> ...
   ```
   First call with no done folders returns all leaf folders.

   b. If the ready list is empty (`[]`), all folders are done. Proceed to step 3.

   c. Get batches for the ready folders:
   ```bash
   python3 .archie/enrich.py suggest-batches "$PWD" <ready1> <ready2> ...
   ```

   d. For each batch, generate the prompt and spawn a subagent:
   ```bash
   python3 .archie/enrich.py prompt "$PWD" --folders <comma-separated> --child-summaries .archie/enrichments/ > /tmp/archie_enrich_prompt.txt
   ```
   Read the prompt file. Spawn a Sonnet subagent (`model: "sonnet"`) with the prompt content. The subagent must return ONLY valid JSON with folder paths as keys.
   **Spawn ALL batches in a wave in parallel.**

   e. Save each subagent's JSON output:
   ```
   Write .archie/enrichments/<batch_id>.json with the subagent's JSON output
   ```

   f. Add all folders from completed batches to the done list. Go to (a).

3. Merge enrichments into CLAUDE.md files:
```bash
python3 .archie/enrich.py merge "$PWD"
```

## Step 9: Clean up and summarize

```bash
rm -f /tmp/archie_sub*.json /tmp/archie_sub_x.json /tmp/archie_normalize_prompt.txt /tmp/archie_enrich_prompt.txt
```

Print what was generated:
- `.archie/blueprint.json` — architecture blueprint (AI-normalized)
- `.archie/blueprint_raw.json` — raw subagent output (preserved for debugging)
- `CLAUDE.md` — root architecture context
- `AGENTS.md` — comprehensive agent guidance
- `.claude/rules/` — 7 topic-split rule files
- `.cursor/rules/` — Cursor rule files
- Per-folder `CLAUDE.md` — directory-level context (AI-enriched with patterns, anti-patterns, debugging tips, code examples)
- `.claude/hooks/` — real-time enforcement hooks
- `.archie/rules.json` — enforcement rules

Tell the user: "Archie is now active. Architecture rules will be enforced on every code change."
